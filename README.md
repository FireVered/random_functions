# How to use

first,  ceate a file called ids.ids to store the id of each function.
Then, use gen_id.py to generate a list of random ids seperated by ';'.

OR

use the gen_id() function in fun_gen_2.py to generte a random id.

If u want to read use an id and 5 variables to run a function, use func() and use the id as a list for the first argument, and the 5 variables in a list for the 2nd argument.

# I got 'number too big' / 'number to small' error 
There are probably a few numbers in the power of a realy big number
ook for '4' in the last 9 integers in the which will hint about powers and then look for big numbers like:
10000034 in the input or the 5 floats .
