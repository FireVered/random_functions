# How it works?
it uses random numbers to represent a mathematical operetion and other numbers that will be in use in the function.
The random numbers are written in the id, wich is a string, with 14 values seperated by ',' so it would be easy to turn them into a list that the proggram can use to construct the function and output the value.

structure of a function (| or --  are representing a random operetion, & represents a random number, a-b-c-d-e are know and are the input) :

((((((a|&)   --   b|&)   --   c|&)   --   d|&)   --   d|&)   --   e|&)




# How to use

first,  ceate a file called ids.ids to store the id of each function.
Then, use gen_id.py to generate a list of random ids seperated by ';'.

OR

use the gen_id() function in fun_gen_2.py to generte a random id.

If u want to read use an id and 5 variables to run a function, use func() and use the id as a list for the first argument, and the 5 variables in a list for the 2nd argument.

# I got 'number too big' / 'number to small' error 
There are probably a few numbers in the power of a realy big number
ook for '4' in the last 9 integers in the witch will hint about powers and then look for big numbers like:
10000034 in the input or the 5 floats .

# if you use this be respectful and give credit
