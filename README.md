# random_functions
a generator of random mathematical functions.

it uses random numbers to represent a mathematical operetion.

structure of a function (| or --  are representing a random operetion, & represents a random number, a-b-c-d-e are know and are the input) :

a|&   --   b|&   --   c|&   --   d|&   --   d|&   --   e|&




# How to use

first, ceate a file called ids.ids to store the id of each function.
Then, use gen_id() to generate a random id of a function.

If u want to read use an id and 5 variables to run a function, use func() and use the id as a list for the first argument, and the 5 variables in a list for the 2nd argument.
